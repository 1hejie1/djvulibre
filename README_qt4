(NOT) BUILDING DJVIEW WITH QT4
==============================

The djview3 viewer distributed with 
djvulibre-3.5 does not support Qt4.
Use a recent version of Qt3 instead.

The djview4 viewer based on Qt4 
is distributed separately. 
To compile djview4. you must first install
the djvulibre library and its header files.
