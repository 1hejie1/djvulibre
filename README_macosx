1- How to build on Mac OS X
===========================

The Mac OS X version of djvulibre can be built in one of two ways:

- the Unix way
- the Xcode way

These instructions are to help setup and build djvulibre for a multi-architecture binary (ppc, i386).  Your milage with the following configure options may very in getting a Universal (note: libjpeg.a and libtiff.a are installed universal on the machine this was tested with)--also note that the defaults recommended by Apple's documentation for porting Unix sources don't always work:

./configure \
   --enable-xmltools \
   --with-jpeg=/usr/local \
   --with-tiff=/usr/local \
   --enable-static \
   CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" \
   CXXFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" \
   LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386"


The option that works for local builds (you'll have to lipo things together if you chose this route) is:

./configure \
 --enable-xmltools --enable-static \
 --with-jpeg=/usr/local --with-tiff=/usr/local


Or you can just open the macosx/DjVuLibre/DjVuLibre.xcodeproj and build everything that way (some modification may be required for pre-Tiger distributions).
