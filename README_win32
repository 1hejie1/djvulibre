1- How to build on Windows
===========================

- Using Mingw (still contrived but improving)
   $ configure --enable-static --disable-shared LIBS=-lmsvcp60
   $ make THREAD_CFLAGS=-DTHREADMODEL=WINTHREADS

- Using Microsoft Visual Studio: 
  You might have success using the project files
  located in the directories 'tools' and 'xmltools'.
  (note: these files should be located in a global win32 directory instead)

- Using Cygwin: 
  The 'configure && make && make install' method should work.
