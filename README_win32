1- How to build on Windows
===========================

There are many ways.

- Using Cygwin: 
  The 'configure && make && make install' method should work.

- Using Microsoft Visual Studio: 
  You might have success using the project files
  located in the directories 'tools' and 'xmltools'.
  (note: these files should be located in a global win32 directory instead)
