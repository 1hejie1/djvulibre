These subdirectories install additional files for localized versions of djvulibre.  
These additional files are mostly documentation and man pages. 
The message files are located in djvu/share/osi and gui/djview/i18n.

More information can be found in the Makefiles.
These Makefiles are not called by the main Makefile.
You must call them by hand at install time:
    make -C i18n/XXX install
