.SH NAME
djvused \- Multi-purpose DjVu document editor.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djvused [" "options" "] " "djvufile"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Program
.B djvused 
is a powerful command line tool for manipulating multi-page documents,
editing annotation chunks, editing hidden text layers, pre-computing
thumbnail images, and more.  The program first reads the DjVu document
.I djvufile
and executes a number of djvused commands.

Djvused commands can be read from a specific file (when option
.B -f
is specified), read from the command line (when option
.B -e
is specified), or read from the standard input (the default).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-v"
Cause 
.B djvused 
to print a command line prompt before reading commands
and a brief message describing how each command was executed.
This option is very useful for debugging djvused scripts
and also for interactively entering djvused commands on
the standard input.
.TP
.BI "-f " "scriptfile"
Cause
.B djvused
to read commands from file
.IR scriptfile .
.TP
.BI "-e " "command"
Cause
.B djvused
to execute the commands specified by the option argument
.IR commands .
It is advisable to surround the djvused commands by single
quotes in order to prevent unwanted shell expansion.
.TP
.BI "-s"
Cause 
.B djvused
to save the file 
.I djvufile
after executing the specified commands.
This is similar to executing command
.B save
immediately before terminating the program.
.TP
.BI "-n"
Cause 
.B djvused 
to disregard save commands.
This is useful for debugging djvused scripts
without overwriting files on your disk.

.SH DJVUSED EXAMPLES
There are many ways to use program
.BR djvused .
The following examples illustrate 
some common uses of this program.

.SS Obtaining the size of a page
Command 
.B size 
outputs the width and height of the selected pages
using a
.SM HTML
friendly syntax. 
For instance, the following command prints the size 
of page
.I 3
of document
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'select 3; size'"
.PP

.SS Extracting the hidden text
Command
.B print-pure-txt
outputs the text associated with a page or a document.
For instance, the following shell command outputs the text
for the entire document.  Lines and pages are delimited
by the usual control characters.
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'print-pure-txt'"
.PP
Command
.B print-txt
produces a more extensive output describing the structure
and the location of the text components.  The syntax of this
output is described later in this man page.  For instance, 
the following shell command outputs extended text information
for page 
.I 3 
of document
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'select 3; print-txt'"
.PP

.SS Extracting the annotations
Annotation data can be extracted using command 
.BR print-ant .
The syntax of the annotation data is described later in this man page.
For instance, the following shell command outputs the annotation data
for the first page of document
.BR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'select 1; print-ant'"
.PP
Command 
.B print-ant
only prints the annotations stored in the selected component file.
Command
.B print-merged-ant
also retrieves annotations from all the component files 
referenced by the current page (using 
.SM INCL
chunks) and prints the merged information.

.SS Dumping/restoring annotations and text
Three commands,
.BR "output-txt" ", " "output-ant" ", and " "output-all" ","
produce djvused scripts.  For instance, the following shell command
produces a djvused script,
.IR myfile.dsed ,
that recreates all the text and annotation data
in document
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'output-all' > " "myfile.dsed"
.PP
Script
.I myfile.dsed
is a text file that can be easily edited.  The following shell command
then recreates the text and annotation information in file
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -f " "myfile.dsed" " -s"

.SS Extracting a page
Both commands
.B save-page
and
.B save-page-with
create a DjVu file representing the selected component file of a
document.  The following shell command, for instance, creates a file
.I p05.djvu
containing page
.I 5
of document
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'select 5; save-page " "p05.djvu" "'"
.PP
Each page of a document might import data from 
another component file using the so-called inclusion (
.SM INCL
) chunks.  Command
.B save-page
then produces a file with unresolved references to imported data.  
Such a file should then be made part of a multi-page document
containing the required data in other component files.
On the other hand, command 
.B save-page-with
copies all the imported data into the output file.
This file is direcly viewable. Yet collecting several
such files into a multipage document might lead
to useless data replication.

.SS Pre-computing thumbnails
Commands 
.B set-thumbnails
constructs thumbnails that can be later displayed by
DjVu viewers.  The following shell command, for instance,
computes thumbnails of size 
.IR 64 x 64
pixels for all pages of file
.IR myfile.djvu .
.IP "" 3
.BI "djvused " "myfile.djvu" " -e 'set-thumbnails 64'"

.SH DJVUSED COMMANDS
Command lines might contain zero, one, or more djvused commands and an
optional comment.  Multiple djvused commands must be separated by a
semicolon character ';'.  Comments are introduced by the '#' character
and extend until the end of the command line.

.SS Selection commands
Multi-page DjVu documents are composed of a number of component files.
Most component files describe a specific page of a document.  Some
component files contain information shared by several pages such as
shared image data, shared annotations or thumbnails.  Many djvused
commands operate on selected component files.  All component files are
initially selected.  The following commands are useful for changing
the selection.
.TP
.BI "ls"
List all component files in the document.  Each line contains an
optional page number, a letter describing the component file type, the
size of the component file, and the identifier of the component file.
Component file type letters
.BR P ", " I ", " A ", and " T 
respectively stand for page data, shared image data, shared annotation
data, and thumbnail data.  Page numbers are only listed for component
files containing page data.
.TP
.BI "select [" "fileid" "]"
Select the component file identified by argument
.IR fileid .
Argument 
.I fileid
must be either a page number or a component file identifier.
The
.B select
command selects all component files
when the argument
.I fileid
is omitted.
.TP
.BI "select-shared-ant"
Select a component file containing shared annotations.  
Only one such component file is supported by the current DjVu software. 
This component file usually contains annotations pertaining to the 
whole document as opposed to specific pages.  An error message 
is displayed if there is no such component file.
.TP
.BI "create-shared-ant"
Create and select a component file containing shared annotations.
This command only selects the shared annotation component file if such
a component file already exists.  Otherwise it creates a new shared
annotation component file and makes sure that it is imported by all
pages in the document.

.SS Miscellaneous commands
.TP
.BI "help"
Display a help message listing all commands supported by
.BR djvused .
.TP
.BI "n"
Print the total number of pages in the document.
.TP
.BI "dump"
Display the 
.SM EA IFF 85
structure of the document or of the selected component file.
A similar capability is offered by program
.BR djvudump .
.TP
.BI "size"
Display the width and the height of the selected pages.  The
dimensions of each page are displayed using a syntax suitable for
direct insertion into the
.SM <EMBED...></EMBED>
tags.

.SS Text and annotation commands
.TP
.BI "print-pure-txt"
Print the text stored in the hidden text layer of the selected pages.
A similar capability is offered by program
.BR djvutxt .
Structural information is sometimes represented by control characters.
Text from different pages is delimited by form feed characters
("\\f").  Lines are delimited by newline characters ("\\n").  Columns,
regions, and paragraphs are sometimes delimited by vertical tab
("\\013"), group separators ("\\035") and unit separators ("\\037")
respectively.
.TP
.BI "print-txt"
Prints extensive hidden text information for the selected pages.
This information describes the structure of the text on the 
document page and locates the structural elements in the page image.
The syntax of this output is described later in this man page.
.TP
.BI "remove-txt"
Remove the hidden text information from the selected component files.
For instance, executing commands
.BR "select" " and " "remove-txt"
removes all hidden text information from the DjVu document.
.TP
.BI "set-txt [" "djvusedtxtfile" "]"
Insert hidden text information into the selected pages.
The optional argument
.I djvusedtxtfile
names a file containing the hidden text information.
This file must contain data similar to what is produced
by command
.B print-txt . 
When the optional argument is omitted, the
program reads the hidden text information from the djvused script
until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.
.TP
.BI "output-txt"
Prints a djvused script that reconstructs the hidden text
information for the selected pages.  This script can later
be edited and executed by invoking program
.B djvused
with option
.BR -f .
.TP
.BI "print-ant"
Prints the annotations of the selected component file.
The annotation data is represented using a simple syntax
described later in this document.
.TP
.BI "print-merged-ant"
Merge the annotations stored in the selected component files
with the annotations imported from other component files such
as the shared annotation component file..
The annotation data is represented using a simple syntax
described later in this document.
TP
.BI "remove-ant"
Remove the annotation information from the selected component files.
For instance, executing commands
.BR "select" " and " "remove-ant"
removes all annotation information from the DjVu document.
.TP
.BI "set-ant [" "djvusedantfile" "]"
Set the annotations of the selected component file.
The optional argument
.I djvusedantfile
names a file containing the annotation data.
This file must contain data similar to what is produced
by command
.BR print-ant . 
When the optional argument is omitted, the
program reads the annotation data from the djvused script itself
until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.
.TP
.BI "output-ant"
Print a djvused script that reconstructs the annotation
information for the selected pages.  This script can later
be edited and executed by invoking program
.B djvused
with option
.BR -f .
.TP
.BI "print-meta"
Print the meta-data part of the annotations for the selected component file.
This command displays a subset of the information printed by command
.B print-ant
using a different syntax.  Metadata are organized as key\-value pairs.
Each printed line contains the key name such as
.BR "author" ", " "title" ",etc.,"
followed by a tab character ("\\t") and
a double-quoted string representing the 
.SM UTF-8
encoded metadata value.
.TP
.BI "set-meta " "djvusedmetafile"
Set the meta-data part of the annotations of the selected component file.
The remaining part of the annotations is left unchanged
The optional argument
.I djvusedmetafile
names a file containing the meta-data.
This file must contain data similar to what is produced
by command
.BR print-meta . 
When the optional argument is omitted, the
program reads the annotation data from the djvused script itself
until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.
.TP
.BI "output-all"
Print a djvused script that reconstructs both the hidden text and the
annotation information for the selected pages.  This script can later
be edited and executed by invoking program
.B djvused
with option
.BR -f .

.SS Thumbnail commands
.TP
.BI "set-thumbnails " "sz"
Compute thumbnails of size
.IR sz x sz
pixels and insert them into the document.
DjVu viewers can later display these thumbnails very
efficiently without need to download the data for
each page.  Typical thumbnail size range 
from 48 to 128 pixels.
.TP
.BI "remove-thumbnails"
Remove the pre-computed thumbnails from the DjVu document.
New thumbnails can then be computed using command
.BR set-thumbnails .

.SS Save comands
The above commands only modify the memory image of the DjVu document.
The following commands provide means to save the modified data
into the file system.
.TP
.BI "save"
Save the modified DjVu document back into the input file
.I djvufile
specified by the arguments of the program 
.BR djvused .
Nothing is done if the DjVu file was not modified.
Passing option
.B -s
program
.B djvused 
is equivalent to executing command
.B save
before exiting the program.
.TP
.BI "save-bundled " "filename"
Save the current DjVu document as a bundled 
multi-page DjVu document named 
.IR filename .
A similar capability is offered by program
.BR djvmcvt .
.TP
.BI "save-indirect " "filename"
Save the current DjVu document as an indirect
multi-page DjVu document.  The index file of the
indirect document will be named 
.BR filename .
All other files composing the indirect document
will be saved into the same directory as the
index file.
A similar capability is offered by program
.BR djvmcvt .
.TP
.BI "save-page " "filename"
Save the selected component file into DjVu file
.IR filename .
The selected component file might import data from 
another component file using the so-called inclusion (
.SM INCL
) chunks.  This command then produces a file with unresolved
references to imported data.  Such a file should then be made part of
a multi-page document containing the required data in other component
files.
.TP
.BI "save-page-with " "filename"
Save the selected component file into DjVu file
.IR filename .
All data imported from other component files is copied into the output
file as well.  This command always produces a viewable DjVu file.  On
the other hand, collecting several such files into a multipage
document might lead to useless data replication.


.SH DJVUSED FILE FORMATS

Djvused uses a simple parenthesized syntax to represent
both annotations and hidden text.
.IP "*" 3
This syntax is the native syntax used by DjVu for storing annotations.
Program
.B djvused
simply compresses the annotation data using the
.BR bzz (1)
algorithm.
.IP "*" 3
This syntax differs from the native syntax used by DjVu for
storing the hidden text.  Program 
.B djvused
performs the translations between the compact binary representation
used by DjVu and the easily modifiable parenthesized syntax.
.PP
.SS General syntax

.SS Hidden text syntax

.SS Annotation syntax

.SH LIMITATIONS
The current version of program 
.B djvused
only supports selecting one component file
or all component files.  There is no way to
select only a few component files.

.SH CREDITS
