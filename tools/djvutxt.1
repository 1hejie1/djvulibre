.SH NAME
djvutxt \- Extract the hidden text from DjVu documents.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djvutxt [" options "] " "inputdjvufile" " [" outputtxtfile "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Program 
.B djvutxt
decodes the hidden text layer of a DjVu document 
.I inputdjvufile
and prints the 
.SM UTF8
encoded text into file
.I outputtxtfile
or the standard output.
No output is produced if the file contains no hidden text layer.
The hidden text layer is usually generated with the help of an 
optical character recognition software.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-page=" "pagespec"
Specify which pages should be processed.
When this option is not specified,
the text of all pages of the documents is
concatenated into the output file.
The page specification
.I pagespec 
contains one or more comma-separated page ranges.
A page range is either a page number, 
or two page numbers separated by a dash.
For instance, specification
.BR "1-10" 
outputs pages 1 to 10, and specification
.BR "1,3,99999-4"
outputs pages 1 and 3, followed by all the document
pages in reverse order up to page 4.
.TP
.BI "-detail=" "keyword"
This options causes
.B djvutxt
to output s-expressions 
specifying the position of the text in the page.
See the manual page
.BR djvused (1)
for a description of the output format.
Argument 
.I keyword
specifies the maximum level of detail
for which text location is reported.
The recognized values are:
.BR page ", " region ", " para ", "
.BR line ", " word ", and " char "."
All other values are interpreted as 
.BR char .


.SH REMARKS
Use program
.BR djvused (1)
for more control over the text layer.
