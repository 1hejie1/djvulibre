.TH CJB2 1 "10/11/2001" "DjVuLibre-3.5" "DjVuLibre-3.5"
.SH NAME
cjb2 \- Simple DjVuBitonal encoder.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cjb2  [" "options" "] " "inputfile" " " "outputdjvufile"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple encoder for bitonal files.
Argument 
.I inputfile
is the name of a 
.SM PBM
or bitonal
.SM TIFF
file containing a single document image.
This program produces a DjVuBitonal file named
.IR outputdjvufile .

The default compression process is lossless: decoding the DjVuBitonal file at
full resolution will produce an image exactly identical to the input file.
Lossy compression is enabled by selecting option
.B -clean 
and/or option
.BR -loose .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-dpi " "n"
Specify the resolution information encoded into the output file expressed in
dots per inch. The resolution information encoded in DjVu files determine how
the decoder scales the image on a particular display.  Meaningful resolutions
range from 25 to 1200.  The default resolution for 
.SM TIFF
files is the resolution is the resolution specified by the input file.
The default resolution for
.SM PBM
files is 300 dpi.
.TP
.B "-clean"
Remove flyspecks from the input image. 
This option enables a heuristic algorithm that removes very small marks.  
Such marks are often causes by noise and dust during the scanning process.
The threshold mark size is chosen according to the resolution
specified with option 
.BR -dpi .
.TP
.B "-loose"
Substitute patterns with small variations.
This option enables a heuristic algorithm that encodes certain characters
by simply replicating the shape of a previously encoded character.
The shape difference between both characters must represent less
than 6% of the pixels in the character bounding box.
.TP
.B "-verbose"
Display informational messages while running.

.SH REMARKS
Lossless encoding is competitive with that of the Lizardtech commercial
encoders.  Lossy encoding mode lags behind.  Additional algorithms could
improve the overall performance:
.IP "*" 3
Detecting small marks belonging to half-tone patterns
would improve compression speed.
.IP "*" 3
Multi-page character matches would improve the
compression ratios for multi-page documents.
.IP "*" 3
A better pattern matching code would improve the 
lossy compression ratios.
