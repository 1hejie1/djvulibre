.TH CJB2 1 "10/11/2001" "DjVuLibre-3.5" "DjVuLibre-3.5"
.SH NAME
cjb2 \- Simple DjVuBitonal encoder.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cjb2  [" "options" "] " "inputfile" " " "outputdjvufile"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple encoder for bitonal files.
Argument 
.I inputfile
is the name of a 
.SM PBM
or bitonal
.SM TIFF
file containing a single document image.
This program produces a DjVuBitonal file named
.IR outputdjvufile .

The default compression process is lossless: decoding the DjVuBitonal file at
full resolution will produce an image exactly identical to the input file.
Lossy compression is enabled by selecting option
.B -lossy 
or option
.BR -clean .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-dpi " "n"
Specify the resolution information encoded into the output file expressed in
dots per inch. The resolution information encoded in DjVu files determine how
the decoder scales the image on a particular display.  Meaningful resolutions
range from 25 to 1200.  The default resolution for 
.SM TIFF
files is the resolution is the resolution specified by the input file.
The default resolution for
.SM PBM
files is 300 dpi.
.TP
.B "-clean"
Remove flyspecks from the input image. 
This option enables a heuristic algorithm that removes very small marks.  
Such marks are often causes by noise and dust during the scanning process.
The threshold mark size is chosen according to the resolution
specified with option 
.BR -dpi .
.TP
.B "-lossy"
Substitute patterns with small variations.
This option enables a heuristic algorithm that encodes certain characters
by simply replicating the shape of a previously encoded character.
This option implies
.BR --clean .
.TP
.B "-verbose"
Display informational messages while running.

.SH REMARKS
Lossless encoding is competitive with that of the 
Lizardtech commercial encoders. 
The performance of the lossy encoding mode
was much improved by the new pattern matching code 
contributed by Ilya Mezhirov.  However it still
lags behind the performance of commercial encoders.
Two notable features are missing:
.IP "*" 3
Half-tone detection. Collecting small marks belonging 
to half-tone patterns would improve compression speed.
.IP "*" 3
Multi-page compression. Matching characters on several pages
would improve the compression ratios for multi-page documents.

.SH CREDITS
This program was initially written by L\('eon Bottou
<leonb@users.sourceforge.net> and was improved by Bill Riemers
<docbill@sourceforge.net> and many others.
The pattern matching algorithm for lossy compression
was contributed by Ilya Mezhirov <ilya@mezhirov.mccme.ru>.
