.SH BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
.SS Netscape 4
.PP
The DjVu browser plugin is normally installed in directory
.BR /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins .
This is suficient to enable the DjVu browser plugin 
because Netscape 4 always searches this directory for 
plugins.
.PP
You might have to first remove previous version of the DjVu plugin.  
Selecting menu 
.B "Help->About Plugins" 
in 
.B netscape 
displays the current list of plugins.  
Previous versions of the plugin might be installed in one of 
the following locations:
.IP "" 2
.B "$HOME/.netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.br
.B "/usr/lib/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.br
.B "/opt/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.PP
More complicated cases can be solved by creating a symbolic 
link into your personal plugin directory:
.IP "" 2
.B "cd $HOME/.netscape/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
You must not copy 
.B NSDEJAVUSO 
but create a symbolic link.  This is necessary
because 
.B NSDEJAVUSO 
first locates its normal installation directory by following the symbolic
link.  

The Netscape plugin search rules are explained in the
.B README 
file that comes with the Netscape distribution.  
Also check option
.B -fix
of program
.BR djview .
.PP
.SS Netscape 6
.PP
The DjVu plugin works nicely with Netscape 6.1 or better.
It seems that Netscape 6 only recognize plugins installed inside 
its own plugin directory.  This can be done using a symbolic link.  
Let us assume that Netscape 6 is installed in 
.BR /usr/local/netscape6 .
The following commands should do the trick:
.IP "" 2
.B "cd /usr/local/netscape6/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
.SS Mozilla
.PP
The DjVu plugin works nicely with Mozilla 0.9.5 or better.
You must establish a link from the Mozilla plugin directory.  
Assuming that Mozilla is installed under 
.BR /usr :
.IP "" 2
.B "cd /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
You can then restart
.B mozilla
and select menu 
.B "Help->About Plugins" to check
whether the DjVu plugin is properly recognized.  
.PP
.SS Galeon
.PP
Galeon internally uses the Mozilla rendering engine.
Install the plugin for Mozilla and it should also
work for Galeon.
.PP
.SS Konqueror
.PP
The DjVu plugin works with
.SM KDE-2.2
or better.
Some problems have been reported with DjVu images
embedded in web pages.
.PP
You must first make sure that 
.B konqueror
recognizes the DjVU plugin.
In Konqueror, select 
.BR "Settings->Configure Konqueror" .  
When the dialog appears, select the icon 
.BR "Netscape Plugins" .  
Make sure that directory
.B "LIBDIR/netscape/plugins" 
appears in the list of plugin directories.
Then press button 
.BR "Scan for new plugins" .  
Clicking the 
.B "Plugins" 
tab button should display a list of recognized plugins.  
Check that 
.B "NSDEJAVUSO" 
appears there.
