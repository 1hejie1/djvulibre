.SH NAME
nsdejavu \- DjVu browser plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO

.SH DESCRIPTION
The shared library
.B NSDEJAVUSO
uses the Netscape browser plugin
.SM API
to display DjVu images in
in a number of popular web browsers.
Different web browsers provide various level
of support for Netscape plugins.
Please check section "Browser Compatibility"
for instructions on how to enable the
DjVu browser plugin.
Both the standalone viewer
.B djview
and the DjVu browser plugin
.B NSDEJAVUSO
offer similar features.
The DjVu browser plugin in fact is wrapper that invokes the standalone viewer
program in remote control mode.  This man pages describes those features
that are specific to the browser plugin.  Additional information can
be found in the
.BR djview (1)
man page.

.SH MIME TYPES AND EXTENSIONS

Typing the
.SM URL
of a recognized DjVu document in your web browser
should automatically invoke the DjVu browser plugin.
Each browser uses different methods to determine that a particular
.SM URL
is in fact a DjVu document.
Web server normally provide a
.SM MIME
type to web browsers.
The official MIME type for DjVu documents is
.BR image/vnd.djvu .
For compatibility with ancient versions of the
DjVu viewer, it is common to use instead the
experimental MIME type
.B image/x-djvu
or
.BR image/x.djvu .
Web servers should be configured to send the proper
MIME type for DjVu documents. See the DjVu tutorial
for more information (
.B http://www.djvuzone.org/support/tutorial/
).
Most web browsers also recognize files ending with
.B .djvu
or
.B .djv
as DjVu files.

An easy way to check if an http server is giving an appropriate
content-type is to invoke the following command with a URL
corresponding to a DjVu file on the server, such as
.BR http://nips.djvuzone.org/djvu/nips13/AgueraFairhallBialek.djvu .
.IP "" 2
.BI "wget --debug --output-file=/dev/null " URL " 2>&1 | grep Content-Type"
.PP
The result should be one of the following, preferably the first.
.IP "" 2
.B Content-Type: image/vnd.djvu
.br
.B Content-Type: image/x.djvu
.br
.B Content-Type: image/x-djvu
.PP
Any other MIME type indicates a server misconfiguration.

.SH CGI-STYLE FLAGS

The behavior of the DjVu browser plugin can be specified by
by augmenting the
.SM URL
using a syntax similar to that used by the
.SM CGI
programs.
This syntax is described by the following template:
.IP "" 3
.BI "http://server/dir/file.djvu?djvuopts&" "keyword=value" "&" "keyword=value" "&" "..."
.PP
The DjVu browser plugin only recognizes keywords that appear
after the word
.BR djvuopts .
Unrecognized keywords are silently ignored.
The following keywords are recognized:

is off by default.

.SH EMBEDDING DJVU IMAGES

A good way to integrate DjVu content on your web page is to use the
.SM EMBED
directive of the
.SM HTML
language.
An advantage of this method is that it will work even if your web server
does not support the DjVu
.SM MIME
type.
Furthermore, the
.SM CGI
style flags can be directly used as attributes of the
.SM EMBED
tag.
Here is an example:
.IP "" 3
.B "<embed src=""myfile.djvu"" type=""image/x-djvu"""
.br
.B "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 width=""100%"" height=""100%"""
.br
.B "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 passive=yes zoom=stretch >
.B </embed>

.SH BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
The DjVu browser plugin has been tested with
several popular web browsers:
.SS Netscape 4
.PP
The DjVu browser plugin is normally installed in directory
.BR /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins .
This is sufficient to enable the DjVu browser plugin
because Netscape 4 always searches this directory for
plugins.
You might have to first remove previous version of the DjVu plugin.
Selecting menu
.B "Help->About Plugins"
in
.B netscape
displays the current list of plugins.
Previous versions of the plugin might be installed in one of
the following locations:
.IP "" 2
.B "$HOME/.netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.br
.B "/usr/lib/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.br
.B "/opt/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO"
.PP
More complicated cases can be solved by creating a symbolic
link into your personal plugin directory:
.IP "" 2
.B "cd $HOME/.netscape/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
You must not copy
.B NSDEJAVUSO
but create a symbolic link.  This is necessary
because
.B NSDEJAVUSO
first locates its normal installation directory by following the symbolic
link.  The Netscape plugin search rules are explained in the
.B README
file that comes with the Netscape distribution.
Also check option
.B -fix
of program
.BR djview .
.PP
.SS Netscape 6
.PP
The DjVu plugin works nicely with Netscape 6.1 or better.
It seems that Netscape 6 only recognize plugins installed inside
its own plugin directory.  This can be done using a symbolic link.
Let us assume that Netscape 6 is installed in
.IR /usr/local/netscape6 .
The following commands should do the trick:
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/local/netscape6" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
.SS Mozilla
.PP
The DjVu plugin works nicely with Mozilla 0.9.5 or better.
You must establish a link from the Mozilla plugin directory.
Assuming that Mozilla is installed under
.IR /usr/lib/mozilla-1.1 :
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/lib/mozilla-1.1" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
You can then restart
.B mozilla
and select menu
.B "Help->About Plugins" to check
whether the DjVu plugin is properly recognized.
.PP
.SS Galeon
.PP
Galeon internally uses the Mozilla rendering engine.
Install the plugin for Mozilla and it should also
work for Galeon.
.PP
.SS Mozilla Firebird
.PP
The DjVu plugin works nicely with Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1 or better.
You must establish a link from the Firebird plugin directory.
Assuming that Mozilla is installed under
.IR /usr/lib/mozilla-firebird :
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/lib/mozilla-firebird" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO ."
.PP
.SS Konqueror
.PP
The DjVu plugin works with
.SM KDE-2.2
or better.
Some problems have been reported with DjVu images
embedded in web pages.
You must first make sure that
.B konqueror
recognizes the DjVU plugin.
In Konqueror, select
.BR "Settings->Configure Konqueror" .
When the dialog appears, select the icon
.BR "Netscape Plugins" .
Make sure that directory
.B "LIBDIR/netscape/plugins"
appears in the list of plugin directories.
Then press button
.BR "Scan for new plugins" .
Clicking the
.B "Plugins"
tab button should display a list of recognized plugins.
Check that
.B "NSDEJAVUSO"
appears there.
.PP
.SS Opera
.PP
The DjVu plugin works with Opera-6 or better.
As explained in the Opera software support pages,
you must have the OpenMotif libraries installed.
