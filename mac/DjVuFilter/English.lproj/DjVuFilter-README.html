       <b>v1.1</b>
    </center>

    <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>DjVu is a relatively new image and document format developed
    at AT&amp;T and acquired by LizardTech (<a href=
    "http://www.lizardtech.com/">http://www.lizardtech.com/</a>).
    This version of DjVuFilter.service is a departure from the old
	version as it is now linked against libdjvulibre (<a href=
	"http://djvu.sourceforge.net/">http://djvu.sourceforge.net/</a>).</p>
    <b>Installation</b><br>
     

    <p>To install DjVuFilter.service, just drag the icon from the
	to one of the following locations:
	<ul>
     <li>/Library/Services</li>
     <li>~/Library/Services</li>
	</ul>
     You will need to log out an log back in before being able to
    use the service. (Please, if someone else knows the command
    that will refresh Services without logging out and back in,
    forward that to the contact info below)</p>
    <b>Known limitations</b><br>
     

    <p>DjVuFilter.service is a very limited decoder of DjVu and IW4
    files. It works as a background filter for images in any Cocoa
    application that accepts NSTIFFPboardType (OmniGraffle, Create,
    PixelEnhance,...). For multi-page DjVu files, DjVuFilter will only
	convert the first page. This limitation is also of note if you are
    using some of the web sites that vend DjVu files as the
    index.djvu will likely not render anything as the additional
    files referenced will not be available on your local file
    system (see <a href=
    "http://www.djvuzone.org/">http://www.djvuzone.org/</a> for
    more details about the multi-page DjVu document format).</p>
