.SH NAME
djvuxmlparser \- Parses an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file 
using the DjVuXML-s.dtd and modifies the metadata of the referenced DjVu files.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djvuxmlparser [" inputxmlfile "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Program 
.B djvuxmlparser
parses an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file using the 
.I DjVuXML-s.dtd
and modifies the metadata of the DjVu files reference by the 
.I OBJECT 
elements.

DjVuLibre contains a non-compliant XML parser, designed to read in an 
XML file specified by the DjVuXML-s.dtd.  This file should contain 
within the 
.I BODY
element a series of 
.I OBJECT
elements representing pages of DjVu files.  Each 
.I OBJECT 
element may contain a
.I HIDDENTEXT
element.  If a
.I HIDDENTEXT 
element exists, the contents will be used to replace the existing 
HIDDENTEXT for the specified DjVu page.  Each 
.I OBJECT
may also reference a 
.I MAP
element.  If such a
.I MAP
element exists, the contents will be used to replace the existing
hyperlinks and highlight areas.

The precise format of the XML output is defined in the 
pubtext/DjVuXML-s.dtd 
file.  See 
.I djvuxml-s (3)
for more details.

.SH REMARKS
Use with 
.BR djvutoxml (1)
to modify the contents of a DjVu file.
